# Pancake-Flipping-Challenge
A Pancake flipping competition data for two players

Summary:
Arielle and Boris compete in the little-known sport of pancake flipping and have both been nominated for this season's "best pancake flipper" award. Half the people in the pancake flipping league office think Arielle is the better pancake flipper, and the other half think Boris is, so they have retained a data scientist to help solve the issue.

Varibales from the data:

match_day - numerical day of the match
name - flipper's name
hand - hand used (right or left)
attempts - number of attempts/flips for the match in that day
score - succesful no of flips for the match in that day
What to determine?:

Is Arielle or Boris the better pancake flipper? Justify your decision. Do both sides have a case here?
